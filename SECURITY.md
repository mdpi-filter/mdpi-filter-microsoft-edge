Security fixes are applied to every version that is still published in the Chrome Web Store.

| < 0.0.1    | :x:               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use our private **security** tracker:  
https://github.com/mdpi-filter/mdpi-filter-chrome/security/advisories/new

Include in your report:
 - A clear description of the vulnerability
 - Steps to reproduce
 - Impact assessment (e.g., data exposure, code injection)
 - Proof-of-concept code or screenshots (if available)

## Response and Coordination

- We will acknowledge receipt within **9 business days**.
- A public fix or mitigation will be released within **30 days** of disclosure, or we will provide a status update.
- If the issue cannot be fully resolved within that timeframe due to limited resources, the maintainer will work with you to agree on a suitable mitigation or revised timeline.
- You may publicly disclose details once a fixed version or agreed mitigation is published, or **90 days** after our acknowledgment, whichever comes first.

## Security Fix Process

1. Assessment & triage  
2. Patch development & review  
3. Release to Chrome Web Store  
4. Public advisory & credit
